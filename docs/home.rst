What is Caravan?
----------------

Caravan is your platform builder based on the HashiCorp stack. Terraform
and Packer are used to deploy a distributed and ready to use platform
composed by Vault, Consul and Nomad.

The idea behind Caravan is to provide a one-click experience for
deploying the entire infrastructure and configuration needed for running
the entire HashiCorp stack in your desired provider. Infrastructure and
configuration as code are the core of Caravan. Caravan supports both
OpenSource and Enterprise versions of HashiCorp products.
