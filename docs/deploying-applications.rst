Deploying applications
######################

Once Caravan provisioned the entire platform, you are free to deploy
applications via the standard set of Nomad APIs.

In the repository
`caravan-cart <https://github.com/bitrockteam/caravan-cart>`__ we
provide a set of selected applications that you can run in your freshly
built platform. The applications are structured as Terraform modules for
the sake of simplicity and readiness to use.
